# Principal_Component_Analysis
# In machine learning we have to choose on which features to work on out of several input columns we have. So, sometimes we need to drop some of the columns(input_vector) or else we can merge several columns if we want. 
# If we wanna do the former then Principal Component Analysis comes into picture. 
# Here I have taken 30 dimensional input feature and then coverted into 3 subdomains --- reducing them in 10, 5 and 2 dimensions and at the end of each I applied a machine learing algorithm (Random_Forest). 
# Though we are getting the same accuracy in all the cases, I need to tune my experiment.
